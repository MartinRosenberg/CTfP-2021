  // your favorite language. This function takes a pure function `f` as an
  // argument and returns a function that behaves almost exactly like `f`,

  // stores the result internally, and subsequently returns this stored result
  // every time it's called with the same argument. You can tell the memoized
  // function from the original by watching its performance. For instance, try
  // to memoize a function that takes a long time to evaluate. Youâ€™ll have to
  // wait for the result the first time you call it, but on subsequent calls,
  // with the same argument, you should get the result immediately.
