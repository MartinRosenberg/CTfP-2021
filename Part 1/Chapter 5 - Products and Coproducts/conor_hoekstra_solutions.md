### Question 2

[I submit awalters 5.2 as my answer](https://github.com/awalterschulze/category-theory-for-programmers-challenges/blob/master/105-Products-and-Coproducts.md#52-what-is-a-product-of-two-objects-in-a-poset-hint-use-the-universal-construction) accompanied by the [wiki for posets](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Category_Theory/Products_and_Coproducts_of_Sets#Divisibility_poset).

TLDR: 

> This means that the product of a poset is the smallest number that is bigger than or equal to both `a` and `b`.

### Question 3

### Question 6

We can have more than one function from `int` to `Either`.
